# 🛒 Retail Product Unit Price Prediction - Mini Project
👋 Welcome to this machine learning project focused on predicting the unit price of retail products using regression models!

## 📝 Project Overview
In this project, we work with a real-world retail dataset that includes a variety of product details, transactional attributes, and competitive pricing data. The dataset captures information such as:

Product Category

Freight Price

Competitive Prices

Product Descriptions

Timestamps and Market Context

Our goal is to build a robust machine learning pipeline—from data preprocessing and exploration to model training and evaluation—to predict the unit selling price of a product.

## 🎯 Objective
The primary objective is to develop and compare multiple regression models to accurately predict the unit price of retail products.

This model is valuable for:

Dynamic pricing strategies

Competitive benchmarking

Profitability optimization

Promotional planning and forecasting

## 🤖 Models Evaluated
The following regression models are evaluated for performance and accuracy:

Multiple Linear Regression

Polynomial Regression

Support Vector Regression (SVR)

Random Forest Regressor

Tuned Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor

These models help capture both linear and complex nonlinear relationships in the retail pricing structure.

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
To assess model performance, we use the following standard regression metrics:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error) – Measures average prediction error

MSE (Mean Squared Error) – Penalizes large errors

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) – Interpretable scale of error magnitude

These metrics help evaluate prediction accuracy, consistency, and robustness.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
This project is built using Python, leveraging:

pandas – Data loading and preprocessing

numpy – Numerical computation

matplotlib & seaborn – Visualization and EDA

scikit-learn – Regression modeling and evaluation

xgboost – High-performance boosting models

scipy – For hyperparameter tuning and optimization

## ✅ Outcome
By comparing the performance of different regression models, we aim to:

Select the best-performing algorithm for product unit price prediction

Understand key influencing features like product type, shipping cost, competition pricing, and seasonal factors

Enable data-driven decisions in retail operations for pricing, marketing, and inventory planning

💡 Thanks for exploring this project! We hope it demonstrates how machine learning can power smarter retail pricing and improve overall business efficiency.
